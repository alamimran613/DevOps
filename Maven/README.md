## Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) Maven is a powerful and widely used build automation and project management tool primarily for Java projects, although it can be used for projects in other languages. It helps manage the entire build lifecycle of a software project, including tasks such as compiling source code, running tests, packaging artifacts, managing dependencies, and facilitating project documentation.

### Key Features:

1. **Project Object Model (POM):** Maven uses a declarative XML file called the POM to describe a project's configuration, dependencies, and build settings. The POM provides a standard way to define project information and settings.

2. **Dependency Management:** Maven simplifies the management of project dependencies. It automatically downloads the required libraries from a central repository, such as Maven Central, and includes them in the project's build.

3. **Build Lifecycle:** Maven defines a standard build lifecycle consisting of phases such as clean, compile, test, package, install, and deploy. Developers can execute specific phases or the entire build lifecycle.

4. **Plugins:** Maven uses plugins to extend its functionality. Various plugins are available for tasks like compiling code, running tests, generating documentation, and more. Developers can also create custom plugins to meet specific project requirements.

5. **Central Repository:** Maven Central is a central repository that hosts a vast collection of libraries and dependencies. Maven automatically downloads these dependencies based on the project's configuration.

6. **Convention over Configuration:** Maven follows the principle of convention over configuration. It enforces a standard directory structure and naming conventions for source code, resources, and output, reducing the need for extensive configuration.

## To use Maven, developers typically create a POM file for their project, and then Maven can handle the entire build process based on the information provided in the POM. Maven simplifies project management, improves collaboration, and helps maintain consistency across projects.
